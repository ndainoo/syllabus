<h1> Welcome to the ever-growing unofficial UNC Syllabus Repository.<h1> <h6> Copyright takedown requests email ndaino@protonmail.com</h6>
<p> Most content has been scraped off the internet archive's wayback machine and from various other archives. UNC does not allow students to access their syllabus managment database, so we must pool resources and create our own repository. The more people use and contribute to this project, the better it will become.</p>
